  "description": "Wonolo, which stands for Work Now Locally, is disrupting the $70bn temporary staffing industry. Founded in 2014, Wonolo is a remote-first company with three regional hubs: San Francisco Bay Area, Nashville, and Toronto. We have built a tech-enabled marketplace that connects businesses in need of front-line workers on a temporary or seasonal basis, with 500,000 underemployed workers in local markets all across the country. Our mission is to empower the in-demand workforce by providing flexible and fulfilling job opportunities for everyone.

We’re looking for a Senior Full-Stack Software Engineer to join our Internal Tools team and own the end to end development of software tools and services that the entire organization will leverage. You will join a team of talented full-stack engineers, QA automation developers, a product manager and designer, who love building solutions that improve the daily lives of colleagues as well as boost the performance of the marketplace. 

This is not your average Internal Tools team. At Wonolo, this team plays a mission critical role in our ability to scale a two sided marketplace that supports different verticals within light industrial (Retail and Administrative, Logistics and Fulfillment, Delivery, etc.). This flexibility makes our business resilient, but adds layers of complexity. Internal Tools partners closely with Revenue and Operations teams to prioritize and optimize ops-heavy processes through technology, thus improving speed, quality, and business impact.

We are open to remote candidates located anywhere in Canada.

What you'll do:


Work with other engineering and business teams to scope, design, and develop tools that will help the organization be as productive as possible
Maintain and improve existing codebase for internal tools to ensure they’re scalable in a high-growth environment
Champion good programming practices that lead to scalable, high performing, and maintainable software
Be a player coach and mentor junior developers


Who you are:


5+ years of previous experience as a hands-on technical contributor
Experience building full-stack applications with React on the front-end
Back-end development experience in Ruby on Rails, Node.js, or Python is preferred
You demonstrate a substantial commitment to advancing representation and inclusion
A team player who enjoys working in a collaborative environment
Strong communication skills with engineers and non-technical team members
Experience delivering products in an agile environment
GraphQL experience is preferred, especially graphql-ruby


If you have read up to this point, we hope you are excited about this opportunity to work at Wonolo! Even if your experience does not check every bullet point, we still highly encourage you to apply. The best hires do not always check off every box of a job description.

Benefits and perks:


The opportunity for growth in a mission-driven and well-funded start-up
Competitive salary, meaningful equity, and company bonus
We cover 100% insurance (medical/dental/vision) premiums
We encourage a healthy work-life balance and offer flexible schedules, an open vacation policy, and the ability to work from anywhere in Canada (no more commutes!)
Generous parental leave plan
Cell phone reimbursement and laptop
Team outings, virtual happy hours, company off-sites, and more!
